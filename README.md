# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This web application predicts the number that you have drawn on the canvas from 0-9 using a trained neural network model. It leverages the MNIST dataset and provides a simple interface for users to draw digits and see predictions.

## Features

- Draw digits on a canvas and get real-time predictions.
- Train the model directly from the web interface if the model does not exist.
- Visualize the input image and prediction results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/honestlyBroke/msint.git
    cd msint
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. If the model is not already trained, click the "Train Data" button to train the model.

4. Use the canvas to draw a digit and click "Predict" to see the result.

## Deployed Application

You can also test the application online at the following URL: [Handwritten Digit Recognizer](https://msint-app.streamlit.app)

## File Structure

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `train.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for model training (optional).
- `train.py`: Contains the function to train the model using the MNIST dataset.
- `model.keras`: The trained model file (generated after training).

## Possible Errors in Output

- **Incorrect Predictions**: The model might predict an incorrect digit due to unclear or ambiguous drawings.
- **Low Confidence**: For some drawings, the model's confidence in its prediction may be low, leading to less reliable results.
- **Canvas Issues**: The drawing on the canvas might not be correctly captured or processed, leading to errors in prediction.

## Future Plans

- **Model Improvement**: Train the model on a larger and more diverse dataset to improve accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation techniques to make the model more robust to variations in handwriting.
- **UI Enhancements**: Improve the user interface to provide better feedback and usability.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback and suggestions to users to help them draw clearer digits.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application on a more robust platform to handle higher traffic and ensure better performance.
